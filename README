Boothby
=======

Howdy, there! Thanks for checking out this code.

What is Boothby?
----------------

Boothby lets you create a whole boatload of terminal sessions
within the current session. Kinda like screen, or tmux - but
also totally different.

Boothby is more like a tiling window manager then most other
things. You can think of it like that, if you'd like. It's
simple, easy to use, and reliable.
